## Dependencies

- matplotlib

- numpy

- scipy

- rtree-linux

## Simulations

As it can be observed that the path determined by RRT star is much more efficient as comparted to the standard RRT algorithm.

  

- 3D obstacles in the area are the coloured blocks

- The optimal path is shown in red

- Pink is the goal

- Green is the start point
